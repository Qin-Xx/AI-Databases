Specifically, this is a credit issuance system similar to DAI, where you can borrow out JUSD by over-collateralizing assets such as ETH. And JUSD is considered to have equal value to USDC within JOJO's perpetual contract trading system.\n\nAlthough you trade using JUSD, profits and losses are still settled in USDC. This means that if you make money, you can withdraw it in USDC. If you lose money, your JUSD will be locked until you repay the debt with USDC.",

To address this issue, we have designed a special contract to act as a trading account, where the user's wallet address is the contract's owner. This design prevents users from changing their wallet address and provides an easy way for other protocols to build on JOJO.\n\nSubaccounts allow users to separate their positions into different groups, such as by strategy or risk level. This can help users to better track the performance of their positions and make more informed investment decisions. Additionally, sub accounts can be useful for users who want to allow someone else to manage a specific portion of their portfolio.",
